# Pneumatic Actuated Ultrasoft Limb (PAUL)

In this repository you will find all the code necessary for the control of the PAUL soft robot. Due to the problems that can be associated with working with it and the difficulty of building it, it is also possible to work using a built-in simulator. The programming language used is Matlab.
