- Code_arduino: Arduino code for controlling the pneumatic actuation bench, which sends the necessary compressed air to move the robot.
- Code_matlab: Matlab code. It includes the control interface, where one can control everything related to computer vision, communications between the robot and the computer, the actuation signals, etc.
- CAD: Everything related to the CAD designs, from the molds to the joints of the robot. They were designed using Autodesk Fusion 360.
- Memoria: Everything related to the thesis documentation.
